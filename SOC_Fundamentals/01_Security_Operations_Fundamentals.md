# Security Operations
Aim is to understand the core functions of a SOC role, daily tasks and responsibilities, understand models, roles and structures.
Learn metrics which evaluate the effectiveness of security operations, understand tools for monitoring, detections, analysis, and response. Identify common threats.

## The SOC and its role
 - Monitor
 - Detect
 - Analyze
 - Respond
##Information Security Refresher
CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
AAA Framework - Authentication, Authorization, Accounting

Risk control strategies:
1. Risk transference (insurance)
2. Risk acceptance 
3. Risk avoidance
4. Risk mitigation

Security policies:
1. AUP - acceptable use policy - what is allowed within an organization
2. Password policy -  storing, reuse, complexity
3. Data classification 
4. Change management - approving any changes
5. Disaster recovery policy.
##SOC Models
- Internal SOC - fully integrated into organization's infrastructure. Comes with a lot of investment.
- Managed SOC - third-party, basic monitoring, lack of transparency and communication, subscription-based
- Hybrid SOC - a mix of internal and managed. Flexible, call experts when needed.

		Tier 1 Analyst - initial triage
		Tier 2 Analyst - incident responder, investigating and remediating
		Tier 3 Analyst - threat hunters, more of a proactive role.
	SOC Team lead(not always)

**//Specialized roles//**. Those you can progress to throughout your career.

 - Identify abnormal or suspicious activities
 - Security Information and Event Management
##SOC Metrics
"If you can't measure it - you can't improve it" - Peter Drucker, american management consultant, author

 - Mean Time To Detect
	Lower MTTD - faster detection
 - Mean Time to Resolution
	Lower MTTR - more efficient IR
 - Mean Time to Attend and Analyze
	Lower MTTA&A - lower response latency
 - Incident Detection Rate
	Higher rate - better visibility and monitoring
 - False Positive Rates
	Lower rate - more accurate detection
 - False Negative Rates
	Lower rate - more accurate detection
